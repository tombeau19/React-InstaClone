# React InstaClone

1. Clone this repo: [React InstaClone](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Curriculum/React-InstaClone )
2. Checkout the `starter-code` branch.
3. This application has all of the structure and logic to build a basic clone of the [Instagram Desktop page](https://www.instagram.com/).  Your mission is to use `styled-components` to recreate the styles seen on the Instagram site.
4. If you get stuck along the way, you can check out a deployed version of the app [here](https://wdi11-instaclone.herokuapp.com/) or check out the `solution-code` branch for hints.
